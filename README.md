# Deeplearning.ai
This repository contains the projects completed during the Deep Learning specialization offered by deeplearning.ai

The specialization is divided into 5 courses taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.
The courses offered in this specialization are:-

1. Neural networks & Deep learning

2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects

4. Convolutional Neural Networks

5. Sequence Models
